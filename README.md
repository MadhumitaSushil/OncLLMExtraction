# CORAL

This repository contains the code and guidelines for replicating the annotations and analysis in the manuscript 
"[CORAL: Expert-Curated Oncology Reports to Advance Language Model Inference](https://ai.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/AIdbp2300110)".

Dataset of 20 breast cancer and 20 pancreatic cancer progress notes were annotated comprehensively by medical experts to encode information of clinical interest from clinical notes. The annotations encompassed 9028 entities, 9986 modifiers, and 5312 relationships. This dataset was further used to benchmark zero-shot, oncology-specific relational information extraction capability of closed and open source LLMs. The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://physionet.org/content/curated-oncology-reports/1.0/).
